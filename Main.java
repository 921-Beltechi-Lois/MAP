                Discuss line by line the correctness of the above program.

        Answer:
        The most specific signatures for the class Amain methods (method1 and method2) such that the entire program is correct would be:

        D method1(ArrayList<? extends D> list) {  if list.isEmpty() return null;

                                   else return list.get(1);}    //  READ OPERATION <=D

        ArrayList<? extends D> you can pass in ArrayList objects that contain objects of type D, A, B, or C. This allows for greater reusability of the method1 method, as it can handle more types of input.

        void method2(ArrayList<? extends C>  list, C elem) {  list.add(elem);} // Write operation >=C

        object that contain C,B,A,D !!!

        --nah
        Why: In this program, A, B, and C classes all implement the interface D,
        so they can be considered subtypes of D and can be stored in an ArrayList<D>.
        This is why the most specific signature for method1 is D method1(ArrayList<D> list),
        so that it can take any ArrayList containing objects of type D or its subtypes.

        The method2 takes two arguments, an ArrayList<D> and a C object.
        The C class implements the interface D, so it can be considered a subtype of D, so it can be stored in an ArrayList<D>.
         This is why the most specific signature for method2 is void method2(ArrayList<D> list, C elem), so that it can take any ArrayList containing objects of type D or its subtypes and a C object.

         Regarding the correctness of the program, the following lines are correct:

         ArrayList<A> listA=new ArrayList<A>(); listA.add(new A());listA.add(new A());
         ArrayList<B> listB = new ArrayList<B>(); listB.add(new B());listB.add(new B());
         ArrayList<C> listC = new ArrayList<C>(); listC.add(new C()); listC.add(new C());

         this.method1(listA); this.method1(listB); this.method1(listC);
         this.method2(listA,elem); this.method2(listB,elem); this.method2(listC,elem);

         These lines create `ArrayList` objects of type `A`, `B`, and `C` respectively and
         add two objects of the corresponding class to each list.
         This is correct because `A`, `B`, and `C` are all subtypes of `D` and can be stored in an `ArrayList<D>`.

        It is initialized with a given count, which is decremented by calls to the countDown() method.

                     the ArrayList<A> only knows that it contains elements of type A, and it doesn't know that they are C type objects. So when you try to access the specific methods of class C, the compiler will not find it in class A and it will not allow you to access it.

         The method1 accepts an ArrayList of any type that is a subtype of A, so it can accept ArrayList<A>, ArrayList<B>, and ArrayList<C>.
        The method2 accepts an ArrayList of any type that is a supertype of C, so it can accept ArrayList<C>, ArrayList<B> and ArrayList<A>.
        By using wildcards, they're allowing the methods to accept a broader range of types, giving more flexibility and preventing compilation errors.

         4. Reference Type vs Primitive type

         All the basic types in Java (int, boolean, char, short, float, long, double) are primitive types.
         A primitive type always has a value, but reference type can be null, denoting the absence of a value.
         -always has a value, takes less memory, created on the stack

         Reference types are used to point objects (String, Thread, File, Objects, Enums, Arrays etc.).
         Reference types are handles to the object which is created in the heap memory.
         -can be null, when compared with == the address is compared, not the value; created
         on the heap, where the garbage collector manages everything, are instantiable;

         -both are used for storing and manipulating data & it can be assigned to variables



         12. How can we create a generic array and why can't it be created directly?

         To create a generic array we can use the following code:
         T[] elem = (T[]) new Object[dim],
         Array.newInstance or ArrayList instead of array.
         We can't create it directly, like T[] elem = new T[dim]
         because Java's arrays contain, at runtime, information about its component type,
         so it must be known when creating the array.

         //dc
         However, with generic types, the type information is not available at runtime. Generics are a feature of the Java compiler and are used to provide type safety at compile-time. When a generic type is used, the compiler erases the generic type information and replaces it with its bounding type (e.g., Object) at runtime. Therefore, Java doesn't know the actual type of the array and can't store type information about it. That's why we can't create a generic array directly and have to use the above-mentioned alternatives.

         13. Define wildcards

         13) Wildcards <?> are used to denote any type/unknown type.
         When used, the elements can be considered to be of type Object.
         When used to declare an instance, the instance elements cannot be read or written,
         the only allowed operations are to read Object and to write null.
         They can have bounds: upper bound by extends (we can read elements of the type given)
         and lower bound by super (we can write elements of the type given).

         14. What is a buffer, buffer operation, stream?

         14) A buffer is a linear, finite sequence of elements of a specific primitive type.
         A buffer has capacity, limit and position.
         Java has a BufferedReader and a Buffered Writer, which use a buffer to keep data which is going to be
         read/written from/to a stream.
         A stream is a sequence of objects that supports various methods which can be pipelined to produce the desired result.

         //They are used to perform functional-style operations on streams of elements, such as filter, map, reduce, and collect. The elements of a stream are only visited once during the life of a stream, this is known as being "eagerly evaluated" and not stored in memory. A new stream can be obtained from an existing one by applying intermediate operations such as filter and map, and a terminal operation such as forEach or reduce can be used to produce a result or side-effect


         15. Processes vs threads

         15) A program in execution is often referred as a process and
         a thread is a subset(part) of the process.
         A process consists of multiple threads.
         A process has its own address space.

         A thread uses the process's address space and
         share it with the other threads of that process.
         Threads can communicate with each other directly, but processes use inter-process communication methods.
         New threads are easily created, but new processes require duplication of the parent process.
         Threads have control over the other threads of the same process.
         A process does not have control over the sibling process, it has control over its child processes only.

         16. Multithreading in Java

         16) A multi-threaded program is one that can have multiple flows of control when executed.
         A thread is a single sequential flow of control within a program.
         Multithreading is used for maximum utilization of the CPU.

         17. What are the possible states of a thread?

         17) The possible states for a thread are:
         new(has not yet started),
         runnable(thread executing in the JVM),
         blocked(a thread waiting for a monitor lock),
         waiting(thread waiting indefinitely for another thread to perform a particular action),
         timed waiting(a thread waiting for another thread to perform an action for up to a specified waiting time)
         and terminated(thread that has exited).

         18. Methods for thread synchronization.

         18) There are two types of thread synchronization:
         -mutual exclusive(synchronized method, synchronized block, static synchronization) and
         -cooperation(inter-thread communication).
         Synchronization is built around an internal entity known as the lock or monitor.
         Every object has a lock associated with it.
         A thread that needs access to an object's fields has to acquire the object's lock before
         and then release the lock when it's done with them.
         Synchronized method is used to lock an object for any shared resource.
         Some synchronization mechanisms are: semaphore, count down latch, cyclic barrier, lock (read write lock)
         and atomic variables.

         19. What is a monitor model?

         19) A monitor is a collection of code (called the critical section) associated with an object (called the lock).
         At any time only one thread at most can have its execution point located in the critical section
         associated with the lock (mutual exclusion).

         20. What is event-driven programming?

         20) Event-driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined
         by events such as
         user operations, sensor outputs or message passing from other programs or threads.
         It is the dominant paradigm used in GUIS and other applications that are centered on performing certain
         actions in response to user input.

         21. ExecutorService

         21) The executor service interface
         represents an asynchronous execution mechanism which is capable of executing tasks in the background.
         It is very similar to a thread pool.

         22. Blocking Queue.

         22) A blocking queue is a queue that additionally supports operations that wait for the queue
         to become non-empty when retrieving an element and wait for space to become available in the queue
         when storing an element.

         23. Concurrent Collections

         23) A concurrent collection is a hash map that offers better concurrency than the HashTable from Java does.
         It does not lock the map while you are reading from it and it does not lock
         the entire map when writing to it.
         It only locks the part of the map that is being written to, internally.

         24. ForkJoinPool

         24) A ForkJoinPool is similar to the ExecutorService, but it has a
         difference: it implements the work-stealing strategy
         (i.e. every time a running thread has to wait for some result);
         the thread removes the current task from the work queue and executes some other task ready to run.
         This way the current thread is not blocked and can be used to
         execute other tasks.
         Once the result for the originally suspended task has been computed the task gets executed again
         and the join() method returns the result.
